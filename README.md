- **Best for**: Quick builds, minimal setup, CI/CD pipelines
- **Features**: Fast, lightweight, no dependencies beyond core tools

#### Method 2: Advanced Makefile
- **Requirements**: Make + zmakebas + tap2tzx  
- **Best for**: Development, cross-platform builds, automation
- **Features**: Dependency checking, cross-platform support, testing integration

#### Required Tools (Both Methods)
- **[zmakebas](https://github.com/chris-y/zmakebas)** - BASIC program creator for ZX Spectrum
- **[tap2tzx](https://github.com/dominicjprice/tap2tzx)** - TAP to TZX converter

#### Optional Tools
- **[pasmo](http://pasmo.speccy.org/)** - Z80 assembler (used by c.sh script)
- **z80asm** - Alternative Z80 assembler (for Makefile builds)
- **Emulator** - For automated testing
  - Linux: FUSE emulator
  - macOS: FUSE emulator  
  - Windows: SpectEmu, Fuse for Windows, or online emulators

### Installation

#### Quick Setup
```bash
# Check what's already installed (cross-platform)

```

#### Platform-Specific Installation

The Makefile detects your operating system and provides appropriate instructions:

**Windows:**
- Requires Git for Windows or WSL for full functionality
- Alternative: Use PowerShell with manual tool installation
- File watching not supported (use IDE or manual rebuilds)

**macOS:**
- Uses Homebrew for package management where possible
- File watching uses `fswatch` (install with `brew install fswatch`)

**Linux:**
- Uses distribution package managers (apt, dnf, pacman)
- File watching uses `inotify-tools`

#### Manual Installation

**Install zmakebas:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris-y/zmakebas.git
cd zmakebas
make && sudo make install
```

**Install tap2tzx:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominicjprice/tap2tzx.git
cd tap2tzx
make && sudo make install
```

### Build Commands

#### Shell Script Method (Simple)
```bash
./c.sh                 # Build using simple shell script
```

#### Makefile Method (Advanced)

**Basic Build:**
```bash
make                # Build both TAP and TZX files
make all           # Same as above (explicit)
```

**Development Commands:**
```bash
make asm           # Build from assembly source (z80asm)

### Choosing Your Build Method

**Use `./c.sh` when:**
- You want a quick, simple build
- You're on a Unix-like system (Linux/macOS/WSL)
- You don't need cross-platform compatibility
- You're building in CI/CD pipelines
- You prefer minimal dependencies

**Use `make` when:**
- You're developing actively (file watching, testing)
- You need cross-platform builds (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
- You want dependency checking and validation
- You need advanced features (debug builds, releases)
- You're contributing to the project

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**"make: command not found" (Windows)**
```bash
# Use the simple shell script instead
./c.sh

# Or install make: Git for Windows, WSL, or chocolatey: choco install make
```

**"./c.sh: Permission denied"**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x c.sh
./c.sh
```

**"zmakebas: command not found" / "tap2tzx: command not found"**
```bash
# Check platform-specific instructions
make install       # For Makefile method
# Or follow manual installation for shell script method
```

**Build fails with permission errors**
```bash
# Ensure build directories are writable
chmod +w build/ dist/    # Unix/macOS
# Windows: Check folder permissions in Properties
```

**Colors not displaying (Windows)**
- This is normal - Windows terminal may not support ANSI colors
- Functionality is unaffected, just visual formatting
- Try using the shell script: `./c.sh` for simpler output

**Assembly/BASIC synchronization issues**
```bash
# If you modify Z80FC.asm, you must update DATA statements in Z80FC.bas
# The c.sh script handles this automatically
./c.sh

# For manual assembly:
make pasmo          # Creates binary file
# Then manually update DATA statements in BASIC file
```

### Runtime Issues

**No signal detected**
- Check EAR port connections
- Verify signal amplitude (should be 0-5V logic levels)
- Ensure signal has clear rising edges
- Test with known frequency source (e.g., tone generator)

**Inaccurate readings**
- Check for electrical interference
- Verify ZX Spectrum crystal oscillator accuracy
- Ensure stable power supply
- Test with different signal sources

**Program won't load**
- Verify TZX file integrity
- Check emulator tape loading settings
- Try different loading speed settings
- Ensure adequate tape loading volume

### Development Issues

**Auto-rebuild not working**
```bash
# Linux: Install inotify-tools
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
# macOS: Install fswatch  
brew install fswatch
# Windows: Use IDE with auto-build or manual rebuilds
```

**Emulator testing fails**
```bash
# Linux: Install FUSE emulator
sudo apt-get install fuse-emulator-sdl
# macOS: Install FUSE
brew install fuse-emulator
# Windows: Use SpectEmu, Fuse for Windows, or online emulators
# Alternative: https://torinak.com/qaop (browser-based)
```

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
```bash
make test           # Build and test with FUSE emulator
make debug          # Build with verbose output for debugging
```

### Manual Testing

#### Signal Sources for Testing
- **Audio Generator**: Use smartphone apps or PC software
- **Function Generator**: Professional test equipment
- **555 Timer Circuit**: Simple hardware oscillator
- **Crystal Oscillator**: For precision reference testing

#### Test Frequencies
1. **Low Frequency**: 1-100 Hz (easy to verify manually)
2. **Audio Range**: 1 kHz (standard audio test tone)  
3. **High Frequency**: 10+ kHz (stress test timing accuracy)
4. **Reference**: Use known crystal frequency (e.g., 32.768 kHz)

#### Validation Procedure
1. Connect known frequency source to EAR port
2. Run frequency counter multiple times
3. Compare results with expected frequency
4. Calculate measurement accuracy and repeatability
5. Test across different frequency ranges

| **Input Impedance** | ~47kŒ© | Standard ZX Spectrum EAR port |
| **Input Voltage** | 0-5V | TTL/CMOS compatible logic levels |

### Timing Analysis

The frequency counter achieves precise 1-second timing through:

- **Crystal Reference**: Uses ZX Spectrum's 3.5 MHz crystal oscillator as time base
- **Instruction Timing**: Carefully calculated Z80 instruction cycles in the measurement loop  
- **Loop Calibration**: HL register value calculated to create exactly 1-second total loop duration
- **Edge Detection**: Optimized rising edge detection within the precisely timed loop

**üìä Detailed Calculations**: See [`docs/TimingsCalc-Z80.ods`](docs/TimingsCalc-Z80.ods) for comprehensive Z80 instruction cycle analysis and timing verification calculations.

### Benchmark Results

*Example measurements with known reference frequencies:*

| Input Frequency | Measured | Error | Repeatability | Notes |

*Results may vary based on hardware condition and signal quality*
*Maximum measurable frequency: 65535 Hz (16-bit BC register limit)*

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Algorithm Overview

The frequency counter operates using a precisely timed measurement window:

- **Timing Control**: HL register pair acts as a loop counter, decremented in a precisely timed loop that runs for exactly one second total
- **Pulse Counting**: BC register pair accumulates the number of rising edges detected during the measurement window
- **EAR Port Monitoring**: Continuously samples the EAR port for signal transitions within the timing loop
- **Edge Detection**: Specifically counts rising edges for accuracy

**1Hz Resolution**: The resolution comes from the 1-second measurement window - the smallest frequency difference detectable is 1Hz since we measure for exactly 1 second.

### Code Architecture

The project uses a hybrid BASIC/Assembly approach:

- **BASIC Program** (`Z80FC.bas`): Contains the user interface and DATA statements with machine code
- **Assembly Source** (`Z80FC.asm`): Contains the timing-critical measurement loop
- **Dependency**: When assembly code is modified, the DATA statements in the BASIC program must be updated with the new machine code bytes

**Important**: If you modify `Z80FC.asm`, you must:
1. Assemble it to get the machine code bytes
2. Update the corresponding DATA statements in `Z80FC.bas`
3. The `c.sh` script handles this automatically using pasmo

- Porting to different Z80-based systems
- Validating measurement precision

### Register Usage

| Register | Purpose | Range/Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| BC | Pulse counter (incremented on each rising edge) | 0-65535 (16-bit), maximum measurable frequency |
| HL | Loop counter (decremented in precisely timed loop for 1-second duration) | Calculated value for exact 1-second timing |
| A | Signal sampling and edge detection | Current EAR port state |
| E | Current EAR value | Current sample from EAR port |
| D | Previous EAR value | Previous sample for edge detection comparison |

### Timing Considerations

The code is carefully crafted to ensure:
- Exactly 1-second measurement windows
- Consistent sampling rates
- Minimal timing jitter
- Accurate frequency calculations

## üìä Accuracy and Limitations

### Expected Accuracy
- **Resolution**: 1 Hz (due to 1-second measurement window)
- **Range**: Depends on input signal characteristics and Z80 processing speed
- **Stability**: High, due to crystal-controlled timing in ZX Spectrum

### Limitations
- Input signal must have sufficient amplitude to trigger EAR port
- Very high frequencies may be limited by Z80 processing speed
- Measurement time is fixed at 1 second
